      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A conformal projection is a map projection that favors preserving the shape of features on the map but may greatly distort the size of features.",
        "b": "A Equidistant projection maintains scale along one or more lines, or from one or two points to all other points on the map",
        "c": "Correct Answer.  A map projection in which a globe, as of the Earth, is assumed to rest on a flat surface onto which its features are projected. ",
        "d": "Azimuthal projection is one that preserves direction for all straight lines passing through a single, specified point."

      "question": "In the process of georeferencing, what is the term used for the known coordinates or reference points?",

        "a": "Projections",
        "b": "Control points",
        "c": "Gridlines",
        "d": "Datum"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Projections refer to the mathematical methods used to represent the curved surface of the Earth on a flat map, not specific reference points.",
        "b": "Correct Answer. Control points are known geographic coordinates or reference points used in georeferencing to align spatial data with real-world locations.",
        "c": "Gridlines are the lines on a map representing the coordinate system (e.g., latitude and longitude), but they are not specific reference points.",
        "d": "A datum defines the size and shape of the Earth and serves as a reference framework for coordinates, but it is not used for pinpointing specific reference locations like control points."
